Shogi game, trying to implement NEAT to get it to beat me.

I'll try to provide a sort of diary of events as I make the game.

* July 2 2019:

Made the 2-player game Shogi using pygame. So far, so good. I was hoping that by now, I would've implemented a simple minimax algorithm to get the game to beat me as well, but okay.
