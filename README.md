Shogi game, trying to implement NEAT to get it to beat me.

I'll try to provide a sort of diary of events as I make the game.

* July 2 2019:

Made the 2-player game Shogi using pygame. So far, so good. I was hoping that by now, I would've implemented a simple minimax algorithm to get the game to beat me as well, but okay.

* July 8 2019:

Was busy, didn't really have time to do this. But now I'm back. Started working on a basic minimax algorithm first. It would serve as a decent bot to train the NEAT AI. Also, I'm still getting the hang of deep learning. But I made a couple of tiny changes to bugs and stuff, so that's that.
